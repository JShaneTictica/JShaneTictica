          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - We weren't the closest of friends back then. We had plenty of typical sibling squabbles and fights, usually over toys or attention. One incident I remember having a Barbie doll. I lost one of the doll's sandals, and...well, let's just say I "borrowed" a shoe from her other Barbie. It became a bit of a legendary fight! I feigned innocence while she cried out in frustration. It was funny.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2012</strong> - These early years were filled with fun family trips to Burnham Park in Baguio City. I got a photo of her riding her own kind (Joking)!
