              HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a series of elements that enclose different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way. For example, you can use HTML to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              CSS, on the other hand, is used to style the presentation of HTML elements. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page. By using CSS, you can make your web pages look more visually appealing and user-friendly.

          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>A general understanding of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li>A general understanding of Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</li>
            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

          <p>
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the essential building block of the web. It's not quite a programming language in the traditional sense, but rather a markup language. Imagine it like a set of instructions written in plain English that tells a builder how to assemble a house.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="HTML Document">

        <article>
          To get started with HTML, open your VS software and input "!" then click Tab key in your keyboard. Now, let's write your first "Hello World"! HTML code:
          <figure>
            <img src="/images/HTMLDOC.png" alt="sample HTML">
            <figcaption>Here is a simple HTML document</figcaption>
          </figure>
          It's a picture, so make sure to input it one by one so you can memorize it easier!
          <h3>Sample Display</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="/images/display.png" alt="display">
          </figure>
          <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="/images/explanation.png" alt="Explanation">
          </figure>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="HTML Links">
        <header>HTML Links</header>
        <p>
          The <img src="/images/a_tag.png" alt="tag"> tag is your shortcut maker. Add the href attribute with an address and you can now access the website, you can also click "a" on your keyboard and then tab. It will automatically show this:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/Link.png" alt="link" width="500">
        </figure>

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="HTML Images">
        <header>HTML Images</header>
        <article>The <img src="/images/img_tag.png" alt="img"> tag is your image magician. Use the src attribute to tell it where to find the picture you want to display. Here is the Sample Code:
        <figure>
            <img src="/images/Imagecode.png" alt="imgsample" width="1000">
          </figure>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="What is CSS?">
        <header>What is CSS?</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Built a website but want it to pop with color and style?  Here's where CSS comes in!  Think of it like a magic paintbrush for your website.  While HTML lays the foundation with text and images, CSS lets you change the colors, fonts, and even how things are arranged. It's the secret weapon to make your website look amazing and easy to use on any device!
          </p>
        </figure>
      </article>
      
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="StyleSheet">
      <header>StyleSheet</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS is the secret code that controls the way your website looks. It tells the website what colors to use, how big the text should be, and how everything is arranged on the page.  This magic code even makes sure your website looks great on phones, tablets, and computers!
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/CSS.png" alt="Css">
        </figure>
        <h3>Sample Display</h3>
        Adding this stylesheet to the HTML sample document that we made, we will be able to see this:
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/Cssdisplay.png" alt="Display" width="1000">
          <figcaption>Remember to add the CSS link to your HTML. To know how, navigate to "How to Add CSS" section.</figcaption>
          <p>
            You may also want to beautify you website more!
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>How to Add CSS</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Websites built with HTML can look a bit plain. There are even three different ways to add these instructions, giving you a lot of flexibility in making your website look exactly how you want it to!
          </p>
          <h3>First Way: External Css</h3>
          <p>
            To connect your webpages to the consultant (stylesheet), you just add a little note (called a link) in the head section of each page. Easy peasy! Here's an example:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/images/external.png" alt="external">
          </figure>

          <h3>Second Way: Internal Css</h3>
          <p>
            CSS lets you add special instructions directly inside that webpage itself using "style". This way, you can give that one webpage a unique look without affecting the rest of your website. Here's an Example:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/images/internal.png" alt="internal">
          </figure>

          <h3>Third Way: Inline Css</h3>
          <p>
            You can add these special instructions directly onto that element itself. This is handy for quick tweaks without changing the overall website style. For example:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/images/inline.png" alt="inline">
          </figure>
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="Reference">
        <header>Reference</header>
